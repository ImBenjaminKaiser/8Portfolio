        <h1>What is GSAP?</h1>
        <p>
          GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) is a powerful and versatile
          JavaScript animation library that allows developers to create
          high-performance animations and interactions for web and mobile
          applications. GSAP provides a wide range of features, including
          timelines, easing, and plugin support, making it easy to create
          complex animations with minimal code.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h1 class="why-gsap-main-header">Why I chose GSAP</h1>
      <div class="why-gsap-boxes-wrapper">
        <div class="why-gsap-box">
          <h1 class="why-gsap-header">Familiarity</h1>
          <p class="why-gsap-text">
            Since I used GSAP in my portfolio last year, I was already similar
            with the syntax and how it works. This allowed me to learn how to
            make better and more complex animations.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-gsap-box">
          <h1 class="why-gsap-header">Flexibility</h1>
          <p class="why-gsap-text">
            GSAP is an extremely versatile animation library which can be used
            to create anything you can dream of, as long as you actually have
            the skill to code it.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="why-gsap-box">
          <h1 class="why-gsap-header">Simplicity</h1>
          <p class="why-gsap-text">
            GSAP has a simple and readable syntax, which makes developing
            animations faster and easier. It also made it easier to re-learn, as
            Iâd forgotten a lot since 7th grade.

      <h1>Fundamentals</h1>
      <h2>Syntax basics</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-before-subheader">
        Similar to HTML and CSS, JavaScript does not <em>technically</em> need
        indentation, it is much preferred as it makes reading and editing code
        easier. However, unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript has a very particular
        way that you have to name things. When writing GSAP code all
        combinations of 2 or more words must use camel case. Camel case is where
        you capitalize the first letter of every word, except the first word.
        For example: camelCase, fromTo, scrollTrigger, etc. Finally, comments in
        JavaScript are started with two forward slashes.
      </p>
      <h2>Plugins</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-before-header">
        GSAP functions with a thing called plugins. Plugins are pieces of
        JavaScript code written by the team at GreenStock that can add
        functionality to the base code. The base code (called the âcoreâ)
        handles animations using from, to, and fromTo, as well as some utilities
        like random numbers and color manipulation. All of the plugins I used
        for my portfolio are free for anyone to use, however some plugins made
        by GreenStock cost money. Some of GreenStockâs free plugins include
        Flip, a plugin to animate elements between states, Draggable, which
        allows you to make drabble elements of your webpage, and ScrollTrigger,
        a plugin for scroll-based animations for your website. I will only be
        going over Core and ScrollTrigger in this overview. GreenStockâs paid
        plugin packages start at $99 a year for an additional 8 plugins on top
        of the free ones and $149 a year for 6 other additional plugins.
      </p>
      <div class="line-divider"></div>
      <h1>Setup</h1>
      <h2>Getting CDN links</h2>
      <p>
        The first step of setting up your project to use GSAP is to get the CDN
        links to the GSAP plugins you want to use. CDN stands for Content
        Delivery Network and is how the code that was written by GreenStock is
        delivered to your website.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="bold">
          To get the CDN links for the plugins you would like to use, go to
          <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation" target="_bank">
            https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation,
          </a>

          scroll down, and click the âCDNâ tab.
        </span>
        Select any plugins you wish to use. If you would like to recreate the
        animations in the examples in the advanced animations section, select
        âScrollTriggerâ.
        <span class="bold"
          >Then, copy the script tags and paste them into your HTML fileâs
          head.</span
        >
        Below is an example of what your HTMLâs head should look like.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-xml">&lt;head&gt;
&lt;!--  Donât worry if the link doesnât exactly match this one. 
GSAP is consistently getting updates so the version number will likely be different --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.12.5/dist/gsap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Other meta tags and the page title can go here. If you want to use ScrollTrigger you can put that here too --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code>
</pre>
      <h2>Linking JavaScript to HTML</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        The second step of setting up your project to use GSAP is to link your
        JavaScript file to your HTML file. To do this, simply
        <span class="bold"
          >create a JavaScript file in the root directory of your project. Then
          add a script tag to your header, and set the source to the file path
          to the JavaScript file.</span
        >
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;!-- Replace the [FILEPATH TO JS FILE] with the actual path to your JavaScript file --&gt;
&lt;script src=â[FILEPATH TO JS FILE]"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

      <p class="bold">Next, in your JavaScript file, add the following code.</p>

      <pre><code class="language-js">// Wait until the HTML is loaded to execute code
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (event) =&gt; {
// Put code here
});
</code></pre>
      <p>
        This code makes the JavaScript wait to execute until the HTML file tells
        it that it is fully loaded. Without this, GSAP may say that the element
        you are selecting is not found. When you are coding, make sure to put
        all of your animation code within this code.
      </p>

      <h2>Register plugins</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        The next step before starting to code your animations is to register the

        Prefers Reduced Motion Accommodations
      </h2>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        As Uncle Ben once said, âWith great power comes great responsibilityâ.
        When learning to animate, you must keep in mind that some people have
        conditions that make them sensitive to excessive motion on websites. To
        accommodate for these people, we can add JavaScript code to check if a
        user has a setting called âPrefers Reduced Motionâ set to reduced. If it
        is set to reduced, then we forgo the animations.
        <span class="bold"
          >If you are following along, you can copy and paste this code inside
          the event listener.</span
        >
        It is fine if the register plugin code is outside of this code, as it
        does not actually animate anything.

      <h1>Basic Animation</h1>
      <h2>GSAP Syntax basics</h2>
      <p>
        The basic syntax of using GSAP is simple and easy to understand. In this
        section, we will cover the basic syntax of using GSAP to create
        animations.
      </p>
      <p>The basic syntax of using GSAP is as follows:</p>
      <pre><code class="language-plaintext">gsap.method(target, vars, options)</code></pre>
      <p>
        The method parameter specifies the type of animation you want to create.
        The most commonly used methods are to(), from(), and fromTo(). The
        target parameter specifies the element you want to animate. The vars
        parameter specifies the animation properties you want to apply. The
        options parameter is optional and allows you to specify additional
        options for the animation.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        Here is an example of using the to() method to animate an element:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.to("#myElement", {
  duration: 1, 
  x: 100, 
  y: 100
})</code></pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the to() method is used to animate the element with the
        ID "myElement". The animation properties are specified in the vars
        parameter. The duration property specifies the duration of the animation
        in seconds. The x and y properties specify the final position of the
        element.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        Here is an example of using the from() method to animate an element:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.from("#myElement", {
  duration: 1, 
  x: -100, 
  y: -100
});</code></pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the from() method is used to animate the element with
        the ID "myElement". The animation properties are specified in the vars
        parameter. The duration property specifies the duration of the animation
        in seconds. The x and y properties specify the starting position of the
        element.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        Here is an example of using the fromTo() method to animate an element:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.fromTo("#myElement", {
  x: -100, 
  y: -100
}, 
{
  duration: 1, 
  x: 100, 
  y: 100
})</code></pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the fromTo() method is used to animate the element with
        the ID "myElement". The starting animation properties are specified in
        the first object passed to the fromTo() method. The final animation
        properties are specified in the second object passed to the fromTo()
        method.
      </p>
      <h2>GSAP Timelines</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to animating individual elements, GSAP also provides a
        powerful feature called timelines.
        <span class="bold"
          >Timelines allow you to animate multiple elements in sequence or
          simultaneously,</span
        >
        creating complex animations with ease.
      </p>
      <p>
        A timeline is essentially a container for animations. You can add
        animations to a timeline using the to(), from(), fromTo(), or timeline()
        methods.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        Here is an example of creating a timeline with three animations:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">// Create a timeline
const tl = gsap.timeline();
  
// Add animations to the timeline
tl.to("#myElement1", {duration: 1, x: 100})
tl.to("#myElement2", {duration: 1, y: 100}, "&lt;")
tl.to("#myElement3", {duration: 1, x: 100, y: 100}, "&lt; 0.5")</code></pre>
      <p>
        In this example, three animations are added to the timeline. The first
        animation moves the element with the ID "myElement1" to the right by 100
        pixels over a duration of 1 second. The second animation moves the
        element with the ID "myElement2" down by 100 pixels over a duration of 1
        second. The third animation moves the element with the ID "myElement3"
        to the right and down by 100 pixels over a duration of 1 second.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second and third animations use the special characters to specify
        the position of the animation in the timeline. The "&lt;" character
        specifies that the animation should start at the same time as the
        previous animation. The "&lt; 0.5" character specifies that the
        animation should start 0.5 seconds after the previous animation.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-before-divider">
        Timelines are a powerful feature of GSAP that can be used to create
        complex animations with ease. By combining timelines with the basic
        animation methods, you can create engaging and dynamic animations for
        your web projects.
      </p>
      <div class="line-divider"></div>
      <h1>Advanced animation</h1>
      <h2>ScrollTrigger</h2>
      <p>
        GSAP's ScrollTrigger is a powerful plugin that allows you to create
        scroll-based animations with ease. With ScrollTrigger, you can animate
        anything from simple fade in animations to full page scrolling effects.
      </p>
      <h2>ScrollTrigger Fade In Example</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        Here is an example of using ScrollTrigger to create a fade-in animation:
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.from("#myElement", {
  duration: 1,
  opacity: 1,
  ease: "power1.out",
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "#myElement",
    start: "top 20%",
  },
});</code></pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the scrollTrigger object is used to specify that the
        trigger for the animation is the myElement element and it should start
        when the top of the element reaches 20% of the viewport from the top of
        the screen.
      </p>
      <h2>Scrub and Pin</h2>
      <p>
        ScrollTrigger also provides a feature called scrubbing and pinning.
        <span class="bold"
          >Scrubbing allows you to animate an element based on the scroll
          position, while pinning keeps the element fixed in place as the user
          scrolls.</span
        >
        These two options can be used independently from each other.
      </p>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        Here is an example of a scrollTrigger animation that uses scrub and pin
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.to("#myElement", {
  duration: 1,
  x: 500,
  ease: "none",
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "#myElement",
    start: "top top",
    end: "bottom bottom",
    scrub: true,
    pin: true,
  },
})</code></pre>
      <p>
        In this example, the #myElement element is animated horizontally based
        on the scroll position. The value of "top top" for the start property
        tells scrollTrigger to start the animation when the top of the element
        reaches the top of the viewport. Similarly, the end properties' value
        tells scrollTrigger to end the animation when the bottom of the
        myElement element reaches the bottom of the viewport.
      </p>
      <h1>Other JavaScript libraries used</h1>
      <h2>Lenis</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        Lenis is a JavaScript library by Darkroom Engineering that makes
        scrolling on webpages smooth. Most of the code is plug-and-play, so
        there is not much customization available. You can use Lenis via CDN
        link, similar to GSAP. If you would like to use Lenis, follow the simple
        guide below.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;!-- Put this in your page's head --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://unpkg.com/@studio-freight/lenis@1.0.40/dist/lenis.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>
        Then, put this code in your JavaScript, inside the isReduced if
        statement
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">const lenis = new Lenis({
    duration:1,// How long it takes to catch up with the actual scroll position, default 1
    wheelMultiplier: 1,// Makes the user scroll faster, default 1
});

lenis.on('scroll', (e) => {
//   console.log(e) // Shows information about the current scrolling state
});

lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update);

gsap.ticker.add((time)=>{
lenis.raf(time * 1000)
});</code></pre>
      <p>Finally, put this code in your CSS file.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-css">html.lenis {
  height: auto;
}
.lenis.lenis-smooth {
  scroll-behavior: auto;
}
.lenis.lenis-smooth [data-lenis-prevent] {
  overscroll-behavior: contain;
}
.lenis.lenis-stopped {
  overflow: hidden;
}</code></pre>
      <h2>HighlightJS</h2>
      <p class="paragraph-before-code">
        HighlightJS is the library responsible for the making the code blocks on
        this page. It works by wrapping the code you want to display in the HTML
        elements "pre", which tells the browser to render all of the letters as
        the same width, and the "code" element. Similar to GSAP and Lenis,
        HighlightJS can be used via a CDN link. If you would like to use
        HighlightJS on your website, simply follow the guide below.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;!-- Put these in your page's head --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/highlight.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/highlight.js/11.9.0/styles/atom-one-dark.min.css" /&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>
        Next, wrap your code in pre and code elements. (Note: If you are trying
        to display HTML using HighlightJS you must replace all of the &lt; and
        &gt; characters with &amp;gt; and &amp;lt; which display as their
        corresponding symbols when viewed in a web browser)
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;
    The code you want to display goes here
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
</code></pre>
      <p>Then, in your JavaScript file, past the following code.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">hljs.highlightAll()</code></pre>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
