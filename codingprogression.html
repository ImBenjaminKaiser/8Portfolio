      <h1>Fundamentals</h1>
      <h2>Syntax basics</h2>
      <p>
        Similar to HTML and CSS, JavaScript does not technically need
        indentation, it is much preferred as it makes reading and editing code
        easier. However, unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript has a very particular
        way that you have to name things. When writing GSAP all combinations of
        2 or more words must use camel case. Camel case is where you capitalize
        the first letter of every word, except the first word. For example:
        camelCase, fromTo, scrollTrigger, etc. Finally, comments in JavaScript
        are started with two forward slashes.
      </p>
      <h2>Plugins</h2>
      <p>
        GSAP functions with a thing called plugins. Plugins are pieces of
        JavaScript code written by the team at GreenStock that can add
        functionality to the base code. The base code (called the “core”)
        handles animations using from, to, and fromTo, as well as some utilities
        like random numbers and color manipulation. All of the plugins I used
        for my portfolio are free for anyone to use, however some plugins made
        by GreenStock cost money. Some of GreenStock’s free plugins include
        Flip, a plugin to animate elements between states, Draggable, which
        allows you to make drabble elements of your webpage, and ScrollTrigger,
        a plugin for scroll-based animations for your website. I will only be
        going over Core and ScrollTrigger in this overview. GreenStock’s paid
        plugin packages start at $99 a year for an additional 8 plugins on top
        of the free ones and $149 a year for 6 other additional plugins.
      </p>
      <h1>Setup</h1>
      <h2>Getting CDN links</h2>
      <p>
        The first step of setting up your project to use GSAP is to get the CDN
        links to the GSAP plugins you want to use. CDN stands for Content
        Delivery Network and is how the code that was written by GreenStock is
        delivered to your website. To get the CDN links for the plugins you
        would like to use, go to
        <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation">
          https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation,</a
        >
        scroll down, and click the ‘CDN’ tab. Select any plugins you wish to
        use. If you would like to recreate the animations in the examples in the
        advanced animations section, select ‘ScrollTrigger’. Then, copy the
        script tags and paste them into your HTML file’s head. Below is an
        example of what your HTML’s head should look like.
      </p>
      <pre>
        <code class="language-xml">&lt;head&gt;
&lt;!--  Don’t worry if the link doesn’t exactly match this one. 
GSAP is consistently getting updates so the version number will likely be different --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.12.5/dist/gsap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Other meta tags and the page title can go here. If you want to use ScrollTrigger you can put that here too --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code>
</pre>
      <h2>Linking JavaScript to HTML</h2>
      <p>
        The second step of setting up your project to use GSAP is to link your
        JavaScript file to your HTML file. To do this, simply create a
        JavaScript file in the root directory of your project. Then add a script
        tag to your header, and set the source to the file path to the
        JavaScript file.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;!-- Replace the [FILEPATH TO JS FILE] with the actual path to your JavaScript file --&gt;
&lt;script src=”[FILEPATH TO JS FILE]"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
      <p>Next, in your JavaScript file, add the following code.</p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">// Wait until the HTML is loaded to execute code
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (event) =&gt; {
// Put code here
});
</code></pre>
      <p>
        This code makes the JavaScript wait to execute until the HTML file tells
        it that it is fully loaded. Without this, GSAP may say that the element
        you are selecting is not found. When you are coding, make sure to put
        all of your animation code within this code.
      </p>

      <h2>Register plugins</h2>
      <p>
        The next step before starting to code your animations is to register the
        plugins you chose. You only have to register additional plugins, which
        mean you do not have to register the Core plugin. If you are using it,
        you can register the ScrollTrigger plugin with the code below.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">// Make sure to put this inside the event listener!
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)
</code></pre>
      <h2>Prefers Reduced Motion Accommodations</h2>
      <p>
        As Uncle Ben once said, “With great power comes great responsibility”.
        When learning to animate, you must keep in mind that some people have
        conditions that make them sensitive to excessive motion on websites. To
        accommodate for these people, we can add JavaScript code to check if a
        user has a setting called “Prefers Reduced Motion” set to reduced. If it
        is set to reduced, then we forgo the animations. If you are following
        along, you can copy and paste this code inside the event listener. It is
        fine if the register plugin code is outside of this code, as it does not
        actually animate anything.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="language-js">const isReduced = window.matchMedia(`(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`) === true || window.matchMedia(`(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`).matches === true; 
  // If the user has prefers-reduced-motion set to reduced, this code will set the variable ‘isReduced’ to true
  // This will make it so the animation code will only run if the user does not have prefers-reduced-motion set to reduce.
  // This code is from this website: https://natclark.com/tutorials/javascript-reduced-motion/
  if (isReduced === false) { 
  // Put animation code here
  }</code></pre>
    </div>
    <p>
      If you are following along to setup your project to use GSAP, then stop to
      make sure your JavaScript looks like the one below.
    </p>
    <pre><code>// Wait until the HTML is loaded to execute code
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (event) => {
    gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)
    
    const isReduced = window.matchMedia(`(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`) === true || window.matchMedia(`(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`).matches === true; 
    // If the user has prefers-reduced-motion set to reduced, this code will set the variable ‘isRecuded’ to true
    // This will make it so the animation code will only run if the user does not have prefers-reduced-motion set to reduce.
    // This code is from this website: https://natclark.com/tutorials/javascript-reduced-motion/
    if (isReduced === false) { 
    // Put animation code here
    }
});</code></pre>
    <h1>Basic Animation</h1>
    <h2>GSAP Syntax basics</h2>
    <p>
      The basic syntax of using GSAP is simple and easy to understand. In this
      section, we will cover the basic syntax of using GSAP to create
      animations.
    </p>
    <p>The basic syntax of using GSAP is as follows:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-plaintext">gsap.method(target, vars, options)</code></pre>
    <p>
      The method parameter specifies the type of animation you want to create.
      The most commonly used methods are to(), from(), and fromTo(). The target
      parameter specifies the element you want to animate. The vars parameter
      specifies the animation properties you want to apply. The options
      parameter is optional and allows you to specify additional options for the
      animation.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of using the to() method to animate an element:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.to("#myElement", {
  duration: 1, 
  x: 100, 
  y: 100
})</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this example, the to() method is used to animate the element with the
      ID "myElement". The animation properties are specified in the vars
      parameter. The duration property specifies the duration of the animation
      in seconds. The x and y properties specify the final position of the
      element.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of using the from() method to animate an element:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.from("#myElement", {
  duration: 1, 
  x: -100, 
  y: -100
});</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this example, the from() method is used to animate the element with the
      ID "myElement". The animation properties are specified in the vars
      parameter. The duration property specifies the duration of the animation
      in seconds. The x and y properties specify the starting position of the
      element.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of using the fromTo() method to animate an element:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.fromTo("#myElement", {
  x: -100, 
  y: -100
}, 
{
  duration: 1, 
  x: 100, 
  y: 100
})</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this example, the fromTo() method is used to animate the element with
      the ID "myElement". The starting animation properties are specified in the
      first object passed to the fromTo() method. The final animation properties
      are specified in the second object passed to the fromTo() method.
    </p>
    <h2>GSAP Timelines</h2>
    <p>
      n addition to animating individual elements, GSAP also provides a powerful
      feature called timelines. Timelines allow you to animate multiple elements
      in sequence or simultaneously, creating complex animations with ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      A timeline is essentially a container for animations. You can add
      animations to a timeline using the to(), from(), fromTo(), or timeline()
      methods. You can also add labels to a timeline to mark specific points in
      the animation, which can be used to control the playback of the timeline.
    </p>
    <p>Here is an example of creating a timeline with three animations:</p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">// Create a timeline
const tl = gsap.timeline();
  
// Add animations to the timeline
tl.to("#myElement1", {duration: 1, x: 100})
tl.to("#myElement2", {duration: 1, y: 100}, "&lt;")
tl.to("#myElement3", {duration: 1, x: 100, y: 100}, "&lt; 0.5")</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this example, three animations are added to the timeline. The first
      animation moves the element with the ID "myElement1" to the right by 100
      pixels over a duration of 1 second. The second animation moves the element
      with the ID "myElement2" down by 100 pixels over a duration of 1 second.
      The third animation moves the element with the ID "myElement3" to the
      right and down by 100 pixels over a duration of 1 second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second and third animations use the " character to specify the
      position of the animation in the timeline. The "&lt;" character specifies
      that the animation should start at the same time as the previous
      animation. The "&lt; 0.5" character specifies that the animation should
      start 0.5 seconds after the previous animation.

      Timelines are a powerful feature of GSAP that can be used to create
      complex animations with ease. By combining timelines with the basic
      animation methods, you can create engaging and dynamic animations for your
      web projects.

    <h1>Advanced animation</h1>
    <h2>ScrollTrigger</h2>
    <p>
      GSAP's ScrollTrigger is a powerful plugin that allows you to create
      scroll-based animations with ease. With ScrollTrigger, you can animate
      elements based on their position in the viewport, creating engaging and
      dynamic scrolling experiences.
    </p>
    <h2>ScrollTrigger Fade In Example</h2>
    <p>
      Here is an example of using ScrollTrigger to create a fade-in animation:
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.from("#myElement", {
  duration: 1,
  opacity: 1,
  ease: "power1.out",
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "#myElement",
    start: "top 80%",
  },
});</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this example, the scrollTrigger object is used to specify that the
      trigger for the animation is the myElement element and it should start
      when the top of that element reaches 80% from the top of the screen
    </p>
    <h2>Scrub and Pin</h2>
    <p>
      ScrollTrigger also provides a feature called scrubbing and pinning.
      Scrubbing allows you to animate an element based on the scroll position,
      while pinning keeps the element fixed in place as the user scrolls. These
      two options can be used independently from each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a scrollTrigger animation that uses scrub and pin
    </p>
    <pre><code class="language-js">gsap.to("#myElement", {
  duration: 1,
  x: 500,
  ease: "none",
  scrollTrigger: {
    trigger: "#myElement",
    start: "top top",
    end: "bottom bottom",
    scrub: true,
    pin: true,
  },
})</code></pre>
    <p>
      In this example, the #myElement element is animated horizontally based on
      the scroll position. The value of "top top" for the start property tells
      scrollTrigger to start the animation when the top of the element reaches
      the top of the viewport. Similarly, the end properties' value tells
      scrollTrigger to end the animation when the bottom of the myElement
      element reaches the bottom of the viewport.
