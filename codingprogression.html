    <p class="big-header">GSAP And JavaScript</p>
    <h1>Fundamentals</h1>
    <h2>Syntax basics</h2>
    <p>
      Similar to HTML and CSS, JavaScript does not technically need indentation,
      it is much preferred as it makes reading and editing code easier. However,
      unlike HTML and CSS, JavaScript has a very particular way that you have to
      name things. When writing GSAP all combinations of 2 or more words must
      use camel case. Camel case is where you capitalize the first letter of
      every word, except the first word. For example: camelCase, fromTo,
      scrollTrigger, etc. Finally, comments in JavaScript are started with two
      forward slashes.
    </p>
    <h2>Plugins</h2>
    <p>
      GSAP functions with a thing called plugins. Plugins are pieces of
      JavaScript code written by the team at GreenStock that can add
      functionality to the base code. The base code (called the “core”) handles
      animations using from, to, and fromTo, as well as some utilities like
      random numbers and color manipulation. All of the plugins I used for my
      portfolio are free for anyone to use, however some plugins made by
      GreenStock cost money. Some of GreenStock’s free plugins include Flip, a
      plugin to animate elements between states, Draggable, which allows you to
      make drabble elements of your webpage, and ScrollTrigger, a plugin for
      scroll-based animations for your website. I will only be going over Core
      and ScrollTrigger in this overview. GreenStock’s paid plugin packages
      start at $99 a year for an additional 8 plugins on top of the free ones
      and $149 a year for 6 other additional plugins.
    </p>
    <h1>Setup</h1>
    <h2>Getting CDN links</h2>
    <p>
      The first step of setting up your project to use GSAP is to get the CDN
      links to the GSAP plugins you want to use. CDN stands for Content Delivery
      Network and is how the code that was written by GreenStock is delivered to
      your website. To get the CDN links for the plugins you would like to use,
      go to
      <a href="https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation">
        https://gsap.com/docs/v3/Installation,</a>
      scroll down, and click the ‘CDN’ tab. Select any plugins you wish to use.
      If you would like to recreate the animations in the examples in the
      advanced animations section, select ‘ScrollTrigger’. Then, copy the script
      tags and paste them into your HTML file’s head.  Below is an example of what your HTML’s head should look like.
      <pre><code>&lt;head&gt;
&lt;!--  Don’t worry if the link doesn’t exactly match this one. 
GSAP is consistently getting updates so the version number will likely be different --&gt;
&lt;script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/gsap@3.12.5/dist/gsap.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;!-- Other meta tags and the page title can go here. If you want to use ScrollTrigger you can put that here too --&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;</code></pre>
    <h2>Linking JavaScript to HTML</h2>
    <p>The second step of setting up your project to use GSAP is to link your JavaScript file to your HTML file. To do this, simply create a JavaScript file in the root directory of your project. Then add a script tag to your header, and set the source to the file path to the JavaScript file. </p>
    <pre><code>&lt;!-- Replace the [FILEPATH TO JS FILE] with the actual path to your JavaScript file --&gt;
&lt;script src=”[FILEPATH TO JS FILE]"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>
    <p>Next, in your JavaScript file, add the following code.</p>
    <pre><code>// DOMContentLoaded event listener code block
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", (event) =&gt; {
// Animations go here!
});
</code></pre>
    <p>This code makes the JavaScript wait to execute until the HTML file tells it that it is fully loaded. Without this, GSAP may say that the element you are selecting is not found. When you are coding, make sure to put all of your animation code within this code.</p>
    </p>
    <h2>Register plugins</h2>
    <p>The next step before starting to code your animations is to register the plugins you chose. You only have to register additional plugins, which mean you do not have to register the Core plugin. If you are using it, you can register the ScrollTrigger plugin with the code below.</p>
<pre><code>// Make sure to put this inside the event listener!
gsap.registerPlugin(ScrollTrigger)
</code></pre>
<h2>Prefers Reduced Motion Accommodations</h2>
<p>As Uncle Ben once said, “With great power comes great responsibility”. When learning to animate, you must keep in mind that some people have conditions that make them sensitive to excessive motion on websites. To accommodate for these people, we can add JavaScript code to check if a user has a setting called “Prefers Reduced Motion” set to reduced. If it is set to reduced, then we forgo the animations. If you are following along, you can copy and paste this code inside the event listener. It is fine if the register plugin code is outside of this code, as it does not actually animate anything.</p>
<pre><code>const isReduced = window.matchMedia(`(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`) === true || window.matchMedia(`(prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)`).matches === true; 
  // If the user has prefers-reduced-motion set to reduced, this code will set the variable ‘isRecuded’ to true
  // This will make it so the animation code will only run if the user does not have prefers-reduced-motion set to reduce.
  // This code is from this website: https://natclark.com/tutorials/javascript-reduced-motion/
  if (isReduced === false) { 
  // Put animation code here
  }</code></pre>
